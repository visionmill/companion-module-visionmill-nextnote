## Setup

### In NextNote Display
1. Open **Settings → System Settings**
2. Enable **OSC Control**

5. Set **Feedback Port** (default: `9000`) — this is the port Companion will listen on

### In Companion
1. Add a new connection: **Visionmill → NextNote Display**
2. Set **NextNote Display IP Address** to the IP of the machine running NextNote Display
3. Set **NextNote OSC Listener Port** to match the port set in NextNote (default: `8000`)
